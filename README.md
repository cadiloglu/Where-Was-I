# Where-Was-I
Suppose that there exists a meeting and we do not know how many people attend to it. However, we see a man quitting from the meeting. If we ask the man how many people exist at the meeting he just replies “I do not know”. Nonetheless he says “I was sitting on a chair numbered x and summation of the numbers below and above me equals.
Total participant 8, and the chair number 6 is an example configuration. Because 1+2+3+4+5 = 7+8 = 15. Our task is to find similar configurations by one by one try-out(brute-force).
